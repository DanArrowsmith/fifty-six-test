Taking a specialty is a great way to learn fun new skills and explore your areas of interest in more detail.

To them, and to most, your depth is what determines that “Wow” factor of a dive and with good reason. We as a species have always been driven to go further, see more, and to explore the beyond.  The PADI Deep Diver course allows you to do just that, to explore a plethora of untouched deeper wrecks, reefs and walls and to go far beyond what your average diver ever sees. \n</p><p>\n<h2>What’s Included?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>PADI Deep Diver Manual</li>\n<li>Rental of all scuba equipment (including dive computer)</li>\n<li>PADI Certification</li>\n<li>FREE pick up from Pier</li>\n<li>Amazing dive shop location</li>\n<li>Four training dives</li>\n</ul>\n</p><p>\n<h2>What you will learn</h2>\n\nDuring this course you will learn how to safely conduct no decompression dives between 18m - 40m.

The thrill and excitement experienced as you look upon what was once a living piece of history is unmatched. Whether navigating the outside, looking upon the marine life or exploring the inside, wreck diving has something to offer everyone.\n</p><p>\n<h2>What’s Included</h2>\n<ul><li>PADI Wreck Diver Manual</li>\n<li>Rental of all scuba equipment (including dive computer)</li>\n<li>PADI Certification</li>\n<li>FREE pick up from Pier</li>\n<li>Amazing dive shop location</li>\n<li>Four training dives (including wreck penetration)</li></ul>\n</p><p>\n<h2>What you will learn</h2>\n\nOn the PADI Wreck Diver course we will focus on teaching you many skills and techniques that will allow you to safely evaluate, plan and execute wreck dives.

Using Enriched Air (Nitrox) increases your bottom time by reducing the nitrogen load during dives.\n</p><p><h2>What’s Included</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>PADI Enriched Air Manual</li>\n<li>Rental of all scuba equipment (including dive computer)</li>\n<li>PADI Certification</li>\n<li>FREE pick up from Pier</li>\n<li>Amazing dive shop location</li></ul>\n</p><p>\n<h2>What you will learn</h2>\n\nOn completion of the Enriched Air Specialty you will be able to safely plan and perform dives using an Enriched blend up to 40% oxygen.  During your course will we show you how to use decompression models (Dive tables, or Dive computer) to manage O2 exposure limits, setting your dive computer for use with enriched air, how to analyze your tanks and keep a safety log.  \n</p><p>Prerequisites\n<ul>\n<li>PADI (Junior) Open Water Diver </li>\n<li>12 Years Old </li></ul>\n</p><p>\n<h2>Course Schedule </h2>\n\nDay 1: <br></br>\nOrientation, <br></br>\nTraining Video<br></br>\nKnowledge Development Session<br></br>\nExam<br></br>\nAnalyzing Tanks<br></br>\n\nDay 2: (Optional)<br></br>\n2 Training Dives with Enriched Air\n</p><p>\n   \n</p><p>Want More?</p><p>\nFor the ultimate Enriched air experience why not combine the PADI Deep or Wreck Specialty with your Enriched Air course? \n</p>\n<h4 style={{textAlign:'center'}}>Specialities from 4900 THB</h4>\n        <div style={{display:'flex', alignItems:'center', justifyContent:'center', paddingBottom: '1rem'}}>\n        <Button href='mailto:info@fiftysixdive.com' color='secondary' variant='contained' size='large' style={{maxWidth:'200px', marginLeft:'auto', marginRight: 'auto', borderRadius: '25px', textAlign:'center',}}>Book Now</Button>\n        </div>\n\n  </div>\n\n  </Layout>\n\n)\n}\n"],"names":["useStyles","makeStyles","Styles","data","classes","class","container","fluid","image1","childImageSharp","image2","style","textAlign","display","alignItems","justifyContent","paddingBottom","href","color","variant","size","maxWidth","marginLeft","marginRight","borderRadius"],"sourceRoot":""}
